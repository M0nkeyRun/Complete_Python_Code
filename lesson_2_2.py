Sequential Datatypes
    1. List
        -> []
        -> It is mutable (can be changed *at run time*)
        -> We can store values of different datatypes in single list
        -> All the values are comma seperated
        -> nums = [14, 56, -9]
    2. Tuple
        -> ()
        -> It is immutable (cannot be changed *at run time*)
        -> We can store values of different datatypes in single tuple
        -> All the values are comma seperated
        -> nums = (14, 56, -9)
        -> It is used to store constants
    3. Set
        -> {}
        -> It is mutable (can be changed *at run time*)
        -> We can store values of different datatypes in single set
        -> All the values are comma seperated
        -> nums = {14, 56, -9, 56}
        -> It only stores *unique* values
    4. Dictionary
        -> {}
        -> {key: value}
        -> It is mutable (can be changed *at run time*)
        -> We can store values of different datatypes in single dictionary
        -> All the values are comma seperated
        -> person = {"name":"fenil", "age":15}
